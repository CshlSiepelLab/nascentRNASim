Archetypes manually curated using the untreated PRO-seq samples from the Dukler et al.
(2017) Genome Research paper. Archetypes were selected by manually examining both
replicates and selecting transcripts where:
  1. The transcript is clearly the only one producing the vast majority of the  signal
    (or allowed multiple transcripts producing signal if they all have about the same
    TSS/TES). This is cross-checked with PRO-cap data from Core & Martins et al. 2014
  2. The signal between the transcript and adjacent transcripts drops off to
    approximately background levels between them
  3. The start of transcription is pretty close the the annotated TSS
  4. The transcript averages one read per 20bp when quantified on the combined replicates
